‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

To compile and run this project, you will need to install the ncurses development libraries.

Installing Libraries

On Debian-based systems (like Ubuntu), you can install the necessary libraries using the following command in your terminal:
code Bash

    
sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev

  

This command installs the core ncurses library and the wide character support library, which are needed for compiling the project.[1][2][3][4][5]
